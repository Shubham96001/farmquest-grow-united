# FarmQuest
## Project Title: Gamified Platform to Promote Sustainable Agriculture Practices
### Problem Statement 
Despite widespread awareness campaigns, many farmers continue unsustainable agricultural practices such as:
    - Overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides
    - Excessive water usage
    - Mono-cropping systems
These practices persist due to habitual patterns, lack of effective training, and limited engagement, especially among younger farmers. Traditional training methods have limited success in driving lasting behavioural change.

### Challenge
Design a gamified digital platform that educates, engages, and motivates farmers to adopt sustainable agriculture through:
    Interactive challenges
    Reward mechanisms
    Peer-to-peer community participation

### Core Features 
#### **Learning Through Play**
    ***Transform sustainable agriculture best practices into interactive missions***
        - Apply organic compost for soil health
        -  Practice crop rotation
        - Manage water resources efficiently
#### **Personalized Quests**
    ***Tailor challenges based on:***
        - Crop type
        - Farm location
        - Farm size Example quests:
            - “Complete 3 consecutive weeks of mulching in banana fields”
            - “Adopt bio-pesticides during this crop cycle”
#### **Progress Tracker** 
    ***Visual dashboard displaying:***
        - Sustainability score
        - Achieved learning badges
        - Overall progress towards eco-friendly practices
        - Peer Sharing & Leaderboards
        - Farmers can share achievements
        - Panchayat-level or regional leaderboards promote healthy competition
        - Incentive System
#### **Real-world rewards such as:** 
    - Eligibility points for government schemes 
    - Training credits 
    - Public recognition in community events
#### **Expected Impact**
    - Transform sustainable farming into a fun, interactive experience
    - Foster a digitally connected community of forward-thinking farmers
    - Improve adoption rates of eco-friendly practices, especially among youth
    - Empower farmers to become agents of change in their communities 
#### Vision : Revolutionize agricultural extension by shifting from top-down instruction to a bottom-up, gamified, community-driven approach—where sustainable farming becomes a goal, a game, and a movement.
